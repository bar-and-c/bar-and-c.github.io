Sometime around 2017 I started to pick up an old interest of mine, audio related electronic. I have some education on the subject – a little from Chalmers, but the most useful stuff I learned at AMU in my mid twenties – as well as experience from repairing stuff (mixer consoles, Hammond organ, amplifiers, effect pedals, etc).
It is unclear why this interest surfaced now, but it is very much fun. 

### CR-78 metallic beat drum
I used to own a Roland CR-78 (still regret selling it) and having access to the schematic I decided to build some of the sounds, starting with the classic Metallic Beat.

### Eurorack sequencer
After building a VCO from a kit (Thomas Henry's Maximus) the first thing I attempted to build myself, from scratch, was a super simple sequencer.

### Eurorack low pass filter
The second module I've built from scratch was a passive vactrol based low pass filter. Super cheap, super simple – I really love it because it brings a *lot* of value to my so far sparse setup, very much value for very little effort. It is the best thing.

### Crossover distortion pedal
A distortion pedal that attempts to create crossover distortion (as well as regular fuzz). It is my own idea, augmented by findings online.
