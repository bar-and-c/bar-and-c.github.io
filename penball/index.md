This is a game I developed at work as an easter egg in one of our demo applications for Windows. 
The movie shows the demo application as well as the game mode.

In 2010, our department got a request from the sales team, they wanted a demo application to be used on an upcoming 
convention to demonstrate our products, in this case straming pens used on large screens, e.g. whiteboards. 
My team, consisting of three developers, and our manager, planned the application in a brief meeting. 
The application was to have two modes, mouse emulation (using the pen as a mouse) and drawing. 
We implemented it in little more than a week, in C#, having it ready just in time for the convention. 

A few weeks later I got an idea of adding a game mode as an easter egg, inspired by a classic game, but with 
the benefit of a more direct and physical game control, a pen against a whiteboard. I spent a couple of days 
implementing it. 

This movie gives a short demonstration of all three modes of the application, with main focus on the game. 
One thing about the game, that does not come through in the movie - when there are more than one players, 
it’s actually very much fun. Even some of the bugs are fun – sometimes the ball passes through the paddle, 
which is more fun than it sounds, as it adds a random stress factor into the game.
