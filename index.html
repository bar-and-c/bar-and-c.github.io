  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome</h1>
  If you are here, you might be interested in checking out some of the things I have done. At least that is the purpose of this page, for now anyway – to serve as a portfolio, a complement to my resume and <a class="page-link" href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/hakaneriksson">LinkedIn profile</a>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a class="page-link" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4514196/Portfolio/Home.html">My old portfolio (from 2010)</a> contains a lot of fun stuff that has not yet been moved to this site. For instance, it showcases a pen driven Pong clone on a whiteboard (a really fun game, which is not apparent from the video).

      <h3>
        <a class="page-link" href="https://github.com/bar-and-c/mondrian">Mondrian</a>
      </h3>
        This is an application to monitor our Jenkins and Gerrit status – build and test jobs plus incoming and outgoing code reviews – in a simple but effective and non-intrusive manner.

      <h3>
        <a class="page-link" href="https://github.com/bar-and-c/bubbles">Bubbles</a>
      </h3>
        A demo application for Flatfrog multi touch screens. Don't know if it was ever used, but here it is – a kind of an unfinished game with lots of bubbles. 
      <br>

      <h3>
        <a class="page-link" href="https://github.com/bar-and-c/touchbox">Touchbox</a>
      </h3>
        Another Flatfrog demo, even less finished than Bubbles. It is a synthesizer with aftertouch controlling sound parameters.
