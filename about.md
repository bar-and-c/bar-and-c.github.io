I am HÃ¥kan Eriksson. I do programming for a living, and sometimes at home. 

At work, I mainly write C code for embedded devices, plus Python code for automatic tests, build scripts, and general good-to-have scripts. But wait, there's more: some C# for production test methods, and the occasional Arduino C code for use in our test framework.

At home, it can be a lot of things. For instance: Mac applications in Objective-C (haven't yet made the jump to Swift, looking forward to!), C# applications, Python applications, and even a Minecraft plugin in Java (yes, a very small one). 

[My Soundcloud repository](https://soundcloud.com/egentligen) is a bit like my GitHub: sprinkled with unfinished bits and pieces that I like. 

[My LinkedIn profile](https://se.linkedin.com/in/hakaneriksson) is pretty much like a LinkedIn page, filled with information about work related activities.
