This application started its life as a basic example application while developing an OS X Framework to parse the data from the Anoto Bluetooth HID pens, written in C, but quickly evolved into a pen test application, to test the pensâ€™ compatibility and performance with Mac OS X. So it consists of two parts, a framework that parses the HID data, and the application itself, written in Objective-C. 

The application discovers when a pen connects, and displays a log, with information on the HID events, and a visual representation of the pen strokes.

This movie gives a short demonstration of these basic features of the application.
