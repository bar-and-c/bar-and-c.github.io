# Animator

This is another application based on Anoto technology, written on my spare time. 
It uses the same framework I developed at work, but the actual application is a 
hobby project of mine. I got the idea to make an application that could create 
the kind of simple animations you can create with a pen and a notepad. Plus time 
and patience. Actually, the reason why I never quite moved this past the prototype 
stage is that it turned out to be rather boring. Anyone who made it through the 
entire video above understands what I’m talking about. Spending two full minutes 
to create a 2.4 seconds long movie...

I have lots of other qualities, but I think my lack of drawing talent made itself painfully obvious in the Animator movie. I believe I exhausted myself on having created the spiffy Animator icon in Gimp only an hour before the video was shot. And, coming full circle, I used WhiteMouse to draw the icon in Gimp, using the pen as a mouse, see evidence in these pictures.

And the Animator paper was naturally dotified in Dotify. That Anoto stuff is really useful.

One key thing that actually made me sit down and writeAnimator was that I figured that having every frame on the same paper would make it easy to draw motion - you can always see where your object were before. To some extent that does indeed hold, but it can get awfully messy, and that’s one other major reason for me to drop it. Not only was it painfully slow to get anything done at all, but also one of the big assumptions didn’t quite hold all the way.
(And really, perhaps the biggest reason of all to just let it be - it just wasn’t fun.)

A final note - I wanted everything to be controlled from the paper, or at least the most common tasks, hence the control areas (”Add frame”, ”Clear frame” and ”Preview movie”). And at least that part worked OK.
